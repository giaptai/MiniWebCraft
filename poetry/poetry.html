            <pre>
Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
            </pre>
            <pre>
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enoguh of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.
